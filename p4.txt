Write the steps and then perform to move file from:
a.remote repo to local repo
b.from local to staging area(remove prac3)
c.from staging to working directory

git init
git fetch <url>(here it will move the files from remote repo to local repo)
cd .git/objects(to check the blob to the local repo)
cd<2 char of object>
ls
git cat-file -t 2char_code+<sha-1 code of blob>  #it will give the type of object(because there are only 38 chars)
git cat-file -p <sha-1 code of blob>  #it will give the contents of the object
vi filename
100644 blob <code> tab file.txt
cat filename(note:which is created above with vi editor take that file name) | git mktree
git read-tree <sha-1code of above created> #it will add the file in the staging area
git ls-files -s #to check the files in staging area
git status
ls
git checkout-index -a#it will move the file from staging area to working directory
